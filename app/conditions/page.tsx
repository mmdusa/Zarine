      <p className="mb-4">
        We take great care to describe and photograph our products accurately. However,
        variations in color, texture, or scent may occur as many of our products are
        handcrafted or naturally sourced. These variations are part of the uniqueness of
        each item and do not constitute defects.

      <p className="mb-4">
        All prices are displayed in euros (€). Payments can be made securely through
        the gateways listed in our footer (Visa, MasterCard, PayPal, and others). We
        reserve the right to refuse or cancel an order for any reason, including
        suspected fraud or unavailability of stock.

      <h2 className="text-2xl mt-8 mb-4 text-white">5. Returns and Refunds</h2>

        Refunds will be processed after inspection of the returned product.
      </p>
